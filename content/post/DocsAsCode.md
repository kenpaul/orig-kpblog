Documentation as Code (Docs as Code) refers to a philosophy that you should be writing documentation with the same tools as code:

Issue Trackers
Version Control (Git)
Plain Text Markup (Markdown, reStructuredText, Asciidoc)
Code Reviews
Automated Tests
This means following the same workflows as development teams, and being integrated in the product team. It enables a culture where writers and developers both feel ownership of documentation, and work together to make it as good as possible.

Generally a Docs as Code approach gives you the following benefits:

Writers integrate better with development teams
Developers will often write a first draft of documentation
You can block merging of new features if they donâ€™t include documentation, which incentivizes developers to write about features while they are fresh
